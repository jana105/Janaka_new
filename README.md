Albert Einstein: A Simple Biography

Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who became one of the most famous scientists in history. He is best known for developing the Theory of Relativity, which includes the world's most famous equation, E=mc². This equation showed that energy and mass are two forms of the same thing.

When he was young, Einstein was a curious and independent thinker, though he didn't always enjoy formal school. In 1905, while working as a patent clerk, he published four groundbreaking papers that changed physics forever. For his explanation of the "photoelectric effect," which helped prove that light behaves as both a wave and a particle, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

Later, when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Einstein moved to the United States. He spent the rest of his life at Princeton University. Beyond his scientific work, he was also a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, and justice. With his wild hair and brilliant mind, Albert Einstein became a universal symbol of genius and creativity.
